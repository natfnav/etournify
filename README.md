# Project Overview
This project is all about making E-Sports tournaments easier to organize and take part in.
It’s a platform where users can set up accounts, sign up teams, run tournaments, keep track of
their performance, and tweak their profiles. Plus, it’s got cool features like post-match reports,
MVP shoutouts, and performance graphs to make things more fun for both players and event
organizers.

# Deliverable
A Figma prototype of our proposed website.
